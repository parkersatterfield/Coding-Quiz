# Coding-Quiz
Using Javascript to dynamically update HTML elements, we were challenged to create a quiz on Javascript that could store high scores locally. The start button begins the quiz. Javascript was used to display the questions and answers to each question and assign a class dynamically to the correct button to minimize HTML elements used. A timer begins when the start button is clicked and every time an incorrect answer is clicked, time is subtracted. Your score at the end of the quiz is the amount of time left on the timer.
